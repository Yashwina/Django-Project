# DjangoWebApp
Created a travel blog using a Postgres database that uses an authentication system and allows users to post and update pictures and login using forms which validate user input. 
Also used the Django ORM to query the database and filter post results. The project also uses pagination in order to view the posts with ease and has a navigation system between pages.
